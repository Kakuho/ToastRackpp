Research topics are things I need to look into in, where I dont have a clue 
how they work. 

Research Topics:

  * Find out how timing is split between the composite tv and the cpu

  * Find out how the vram is used, and when it is displayed to the composite tv
    screen.

  * Figure out how the ULA work and why its important

  * Look into how to get input from the host machine to the zx spectrum guest 
    machine
